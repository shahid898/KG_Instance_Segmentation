Ensure you have Flutter installed.\n2.  Create a new Flutter project.\n3.  Replace your `lib/main.dart` file's content with the code above.\n4.  Run the project with `flutter run`.\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n\n*   **Dark Theme:**\n    *   `scaffoldBackgroundColor` and other colors for dark mode.\n*   **Clear Comments:**\n    *   Explanations added in code.\n*   **Dynamic UI:**\n    *   Uses `ListView.builder` to handle multiple transactions.\n*   **Bottom Navigation:**\n    *   BottomNavigationBar to mirror UI image.\n*   **Consistent UI:**\n    *   Uses `Card` and `ListTile` widgets consistently.\n*   **Enum:**\n    *   TransactionType enum helps to give meaning to the UI data.\n*   **Reusable components:**\n    *   Build methods to create components to keep code tidy and reusable.\n\nThis code gives a much better UI, that is very close to your image.

              "\n",
              "2. **Leap Year Rules:**\n",
              "   - The function implements the rules for determining a leap year:\n",
              "     - **Rule 1:** If the year is divisible by 4, it's potentially a leap year.\n",
              "     - **Rule 2:** If the year is divisible by 100, it's NOT a leap year, *unless* it's also divisible by 400.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Implementation:**\n",
              "   - **`if year % 4 != 0:`**: This checks if the year is NOT divisible by 4. If it's not, it's definitely not a leap year, so `False` is returned immediately.\n",
              "   - **`elif year % 100 == 0:`**: This checks if the year is divisible by 100. If it is, it proceeds to the next check.\n",
              "     - **`if year % 400 == 0:`**: This checks if the year is also divisible by 400. If it is, it's a leap year, so `True` is returned.\n",
              "     - **`else:`**: If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not a leap year, so `False` is returned.\n",
              "   - **`else:`**: If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it's a leap year, so `True` is returned.\n",
              "\n",
              "4. **Example Usage:**\n",
              "   - The code includes example calls to the `is_leap_year` function with different years and prints the results, demonstrating how to use the function.\n",
              "\n",
              "**How the code handles the leap year rules:**\n",
              "\n",
              "- The code efficiently handles the exception for years divisible by 100 by checking for divisibility by 400.\n",

              "\n",
              "**Explanation:**\n",
              "\n",
              "1.  **Import necessary modules:**\n",
              "    *   `unittest`: This is the Python standard library module for writing unit tests.\n",
              "    *   `from your_module import is_leap_year`:  **Important:** Replace `your_module` with the actual name of the Python file where your `is_leap_year` function is defined. This line imports the function you want to test.\n",
              "\n",
              "2.  **Create a test class:**\n",
              "    *   `class TestLeapYear(unittest.TestCase):` defines a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class will contain your test methods.\n",
              "\n",
              "3.  **Test methods:**\n",
              "    *   Each method within the test class that starts with `test_` is considered a test case.\n",
              "    *   **`test_leap_years(self)`**: This method tests cases where the year should be a leap year.\n",
              "        *   `self.assertTrue(is_leap_year(year))`: This assertion checks if the `is_leap_year` function returns `True` for the given `year`. If it doesn't, the test will fail.\n",
              "    *   **`test_non_leap_years(self)`**: This method tests cases where the year should *not* be a leap year.\n",
              "        *   `self.assertFalse(is_leap_year(year))`: This assertion checks if the `is_leap_year` function returns `False` for the given `year`.\n",
              "    *   **`test_edge_cases(self)`**: This method tests edge cases, including years divisible by 100 and 400, and small numbers.\n",
              "    *   **`test_zero(self)`**: This method tests the edge case of year 0.\n",
              "\n",
              "4.  **Assertions:**\n",
              "    *   The `unittest` framework provides several assertion methods (like `assertTrue` and `assertFalse`) that you use to verify that the actual output of your code matches the expected output.\n",
              "\n",
              "5.  **Running the tests:**\n",
              "    *   `if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()`: This block ensures that the tests are executed when you run the Python file directly.\n",
              "\n",
              "**How to use the unit test:**\n",
              "\n",
              "1.  **Save the code:** Save the test code in a Python file (e.g., `test_leap_year.py`).\n",
              "2.  **Make sure the function is in a separate file:** Save the `is_leap_year` function in a separate file (e.g., `leap_year_module.py`).\n",
              "3.  **Run the tests:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the test file using:\n",
              "\n",
              "    ```bash\n",
              "    python -m unittest test_leap_year.py\n",
              "    ```\n",
              "\n",
              "    The output will show you if all tests passed or if any tests failed.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Key points:**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Comprehensive testing:** The tests cover various scenarios, including leap years, non-leap years, edge cases, and zero.\n",
              "*   **Clear test names:** The test method names clearly indicate what they are testing.\n",
              "*   **Easy to extend:** You can easily add more test cases to cover other scenarios if needed.\n",
              "*   **Automated testing:** Unit tests allow you to automate the process of testing your code, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and catching bugs early.\n"

              "\n",
              "*   The article presents a new method for smoothly editing the material properties of objects in images using text-to-image models and synthetic data.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Key Points:**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Problem:** Existing tools for editing photos lack precise control over material properties (like shininess, color, transparency) while preserving photorealism. Traditional methods struggle to disentangle material and shape information.\n",
              "*   **Solution:** The researchers fine-tune a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion 1.5) using a synthetic dataset of rendered 3D objects with varying material attributes. They introduce a parameter to control the edit strength of these properties.\n",
              "*   **Synthetic Data:** They use computer graphics to render 3D object models with varied material properties (e.g., roughness, metallic, albedo, transparency), camera angles, and lighting. The edit strength is varied as a scalar value for each material.\n",
              "*   **Method:** The model is fine-tuned on this synthetic dataset, learning to modify specific material attributes based on context image, instruction, and a scalar edit strength.\n",
              "*   **Results:** The model effectively changes the material appearance of objects while preserving shape, lighting, and other details. It works for real-world images after training on synthetic data.\n",
              "*   **User Study:** Their model was preferred over a baseline model (InstructPix2Pix) in a user study, scoring higher in both photorealism and overall preference.\n",
              "*   **Applications:**\n",
              "    *   Easily imagine how rooms would look painted different colors.\n",
              "    *   Designers can mock-up new product designs\n",
              "    *   The edits are consistent, allowing their use in downstream 3D applications like NeRF\n",
              "*   **NeRF Application:** Edits are used to generate new NeRFs, demonstrating 3D consistent edits of material properties.\n",
              "*   **Limitations:** The model can struggle to make hidden detail.\n",
              "*   **Future Work:**  Potential for controlling material edits is encouraged.\n",

              "Turning to global affairs, he notes tensions in Asia (particularly Laos), unrest in the Congo, the Communist presence in Cuba, and the weakened state of European alliances. He pledges to support the United Nations and work towards freedom and self-determination around the world. Kennedy highlights the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, while seeking potential areas of cooperation, especially in the exploration of space and the control of arms.\n",
